2) Distribution Policy

        Permission to use, copy, modify and distribute this software for
        any purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided that this
        copyright notice appear in all copies as well as supporting
        documentation. All work developed as a consequence of the use of
        this program should duly acknowledge such use.

	No representations are made about the suitability of this software for

	implied warranty.

        See the GNU General Public Licence for more information.

        What does this mean?
        This means that you can pretty much do with it what you want as
        long as you don't charge substantially more than the distribution
        costs for it (of course you have to make the source available).

        This makes software distributions like Walnut Creek or Infomagic
        perfectly acceptable.

        It does NOT matter wether you use it at home or in a comercial
        environment.

        If you want to include it in a major commercial distribution you
        need my permission to do so.

A comment from the Debian maintainer:

  As noted in the thread starting at
  http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/04/msg00222.html
  the license is not clearly stated, but to be safe, I decided to move the
  package to non-free.
