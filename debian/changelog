bugsx (1.08-9) unstable; urgency=high

  * Transition to xorg 7 (RC, thus high urgency):

  * A proper review of the license text resulted in:
    - added the whole text of "distribution policy" and my comment to
      debian/copyright
    - moved to non-free
    - more details in thread starting at:
      http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/04/msg00221.html
